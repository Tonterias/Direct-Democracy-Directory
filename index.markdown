## Direct-Democracy-Directory

This is a comprehensive directory of direct democracy organizations. No politics, just organization and administration of references so we can find each other. We have an inclusive approach, not exclusive one.

If you want to list your group, party or organization, please take a look at the information submitted by others and send us yours. We will add it as soon as possible, but if you are in a hurry, please submit a Pull Request (check Google, YouTube or Udemy for guides on how to use GitHub).

We will organize each group in a different subdirectory, so all of you can put as much or as little information as you need.

## Discussions Tab on GitHub

We will use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Tonterias/Direct-Democracy-Directory/discussions) to listen to your ideas about how to improve the communication between groups or about better ways to organize the directory information, communication and the relations between different nodes.

This document will change from time to time, so check it out from time to time.
