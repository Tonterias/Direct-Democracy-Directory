This is a comprehensive directory of direct democracy organizations. No politics, just organization and administration of references so we can find each other. We have an inclusive approach, not exclusive one.

If you want to list your group, party or organization, please take a look at the information submitted by others and send us yours so we can post it. We will add it as soon as possible, but if you are in a hurry and you know how to use Jekyll software, please submit a Pull Request (see technical stuff in [about pages](https://tonterias.github.io/Direct-Democracy-Directory/about/)). We will publish each group description in his own post where you can offer as much detail as you want.

## Discussions Tab on GitHub

We will use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Tonterias/Direct-Democracy-Directory/discussions) to listen to your ideas about how to improve the communication between groups or about better ways to organize the directory information, communication and the relations between different nodes.

This document will change from time to time, so check it out from time to time.
