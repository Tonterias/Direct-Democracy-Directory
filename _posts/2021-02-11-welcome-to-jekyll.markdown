The Partido Raro (Strange Party) was born to prevent politicians from hijacking your vote once every 4 years and will dissolve when a Direct Democracy Law is approved. Our objective is to allow our voters and supporters to make decisions on those matters that are voted in Congress while a Democracy 4.0 system has not been implemented. A system that allows all citizens to exercise their right to vote electronically (using the DNIe or electronic national ID) and that vote is subtracted from the representation quota that corresponds to parliament. As long as this system does not exist, our deputies - chosen by lottery - will limit themselves to pressing the button that has been the winner of the consultation with our voters and supporters. When this law is approved, the party will be dissolved.

For more information, you can check out our site (and translate it to your language).
